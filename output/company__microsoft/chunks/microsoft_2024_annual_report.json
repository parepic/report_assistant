We entered our 50th\nyear as a company and the second year of the AI platform shift. With\nthese milestones, I've found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has\nremained a consequential company decade after decade in an industry with\nno franchise value. And I realize that it's because---time and time\nagain, whe",
    "alize that it's because---time and time\nagain, when tech paradigms have shifted---we have seized the opportunity\nto reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our partners,\nand our employees. And that's what we are doing again today.\n\nMicrosoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were\nfounded in 1975 with a belief in creating technology that would enable\nothers to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief\nremains at the heart of our mission to **em",
    "belief\nremains at the heart of our mission to **empower every person and every\norganization on the planet to achieve more.**\n\nThis year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers\ntranslate it into real outcomes---one person, one organization, one\ninstitution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress\non this front across every industry. For example:\n\n> • Coles is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850\n> Australian stores, ensuring every shopper fin",

All three\npriorities are critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company\nas we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus ",
    "e bar on our operational excellence, with a focus on\ncontinuous improvement across everything we do.\n\n**AGE OF AI**\n\nIf we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our\nindustry has had two dreams: First, can computers understand us instead\nof us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of\nthe world---including people, places, and things---can computers help us\nreason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over\nthe past year, we have had b",

Over\nthe past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.\n\nThe core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws.\nJust like Moore's Law drove the information revolution, the scaling laws\nof deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today's AI\nrevolution. Up until the DNN inflection point, progress in compute was\nkeeping up with Moore's Law---doubling every two years. But we have now\nstarted to see progress in AI performance double roughly every s",
    " progress in AI performance double roughly every six\nmonths.\n\n \n\nThere are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling\nlaws. First, we have a new natural user interface that is multimodal. It\nsupports speech, images, and videos---both as input and output. We have\nmemory that retains important context, recalling both our personal\nknowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we\nhave new reasoning and planning capabilities that help us understand\ncomplex conte",

    "paring consolidated financial\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and\nexpenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve\na significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material\nimpact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Determining whether products and\nservices are considered distinct performance obligations that should be\naccounted for separately versus together may require significant\njudgment. When",
    "us together may require significant\njudgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software\nlicenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether\nthe software license is considered distinct and accounted for\nseparately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily\nOffice 365, depend on a significant level of integration,\ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applicat",
    "cy, and interrelation between the desktop applications and\ncloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance\nobligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the\nperiod in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (\"SSP\")\nfor each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including\non-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates pr",
    "mises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no\nadditional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we\nsell each of the products and services separately and need to determine\nwhether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of\nthe various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do\nnot sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\ninformation that may include market conditions",
    "ing\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable\ninputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and\nservices due to the stratification of those products and services by\ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information\nsuch as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining\nthe SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program,\njudgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including th",
    "ed to assess the pattern of delivery, including the\nexercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide\nother credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as\nvariable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to\nrecognize.

In making this\njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available\nquantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment\nof our investments.

    " plans to sell the security or it is more likely\nthan not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery,\nthen a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment\ncharge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the\ninvestment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee\nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written\ndown to fair value if a qualitative assessment ind",
    "down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than\ncarrying value.

These events or circumstances could include a\nsignificant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating\nperformance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a\nsignificant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and\nliabilities to rep",
    "units, assignment of assets and\nliabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting\nunits, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The\nfair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use\nof a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires\nsignificant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which\nis dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of\ngrowth for our business, estimation of the useful ",
    "growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash\nflows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of\ncapital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit\nchange from year to year based on operating results, market conditions,\nand other factors.

The recast of these prior period amounts had no\nimpact on our consolidated balance s",
    "mounts had no\nimpact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income\nstatements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\n\n**Principles of Consolidation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft\nCorporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances\nhave been eliminated.\n\n**Estimates and Assumptions**\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilitie",
    " affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include:\nfor revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of\nsatisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone\nselling price (\"SSP\") of performance obligations, variable\nconsideration, and other obligations such as product returns and\nrefunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of\nand/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangib",
    "d/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our\nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and\nintangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value\nof, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture\nrates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the\npotential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized\nin our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining\nthe ",
    "al statements or tax returns; and determining\nthe timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and\noutcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions due to\nrisks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our\nserver and network equipment. Due to investments in software that\nincreased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network\nequipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should\nincrease the est",
    "chnology, we determined we should\nincrease the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment\nfrom four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was\neffective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Foreign Currencies**\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at\nthe exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are\ntranslated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.\nTranslation adjustments resulting from this process",
    "ranslation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to\nother comprehensive income.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n***Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue***\n\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device\nproductivity and collaboration applications, server applications,\nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools,\nsoftware development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs,\ntablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent device",
    "d entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices,\nand related accessories.\n\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that\nprovide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such\nas Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and\nconsulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from\nonline advertising and LinkedIn.\n\n \n\n***Revenue Recognition***\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or\n",
    " upon transfer of control of promised products or\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those products or services.

    "re. Revenue\nfrom distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in\ntime when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where\nwe allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates\nare provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the\nupdates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life\nof the related device or license.\n\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements,\ninclude on-premises licenses",
    "nterprise Agreements,\ninclude on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (\"SA\"). SA\nconveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract\nperiod and provides support, tools, and training to help customers\ndeploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are\nconsidered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue\nallocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period\nas customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits",

We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are\nnot sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or\nsoftware updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of\namounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services\nseparately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be\nallocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and\nservices.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when ",
    "here SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do\nnot sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using\ninformation that may include market conditions and other observable\ninputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and\nservices due to the stratification of those products and services by\ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information\nsuch as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining\nthe SSP.\n\nDue to the v",

Certain inco",
    "penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and\nexpenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the\nsame year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as\ndeferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a\nvaluation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit\nwill not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as\nlong-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Financial Instruments**\n\n***Investments***\n\nWe c",
    "**Financial Instruments**\n\n***Investments***\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a\nmaturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\nequivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their\ncarrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of\ngreater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year\nare classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities\nbeyond one year may be classified as sho",
    "aturities\nbeyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly\nliquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the\ninvestment of cash that is available for current operations.\n\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains\nand losses are recorded using the specific identification method.\nChanges in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are\nrecorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based\non publicly a",
    "come. Fair value is calculated based\non publicly available market information or other estimates determined\nby management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we\nevaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality\nof debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is\nless than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic\nmethodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative\nevidence. In addition, we consider specific a",
    "tive\nevidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related\nto the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If\nwe have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we\nwill be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in\nfair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other\nincome (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is\nestablished. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions\ndeteriorate, we",
    "dustry, and/or investee conditions\ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at\nfair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values\nare measured using the equity method or measured at cost with\nadjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to\nas the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on\na periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficien",
    "and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient\nindicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying\nvalue. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") are\nevaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the\nVIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We\nevaluate whether we have (1) the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact t",
    "ct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and (2) the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have determined\nwe are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments.\nTherefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the majority are\naccounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\n***Derivatives***\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either asse",
    "rivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities\nand measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value\nof a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the\nresulting designation.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and\nlosses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting\ngains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing\nhedge components excluded from the assessment of effective",

These levels are:\n\n> • *Level 1 --* inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for\n> identical instruments in active markets.

    "ts without readily determinable fair values\non a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are\ndetermined based on valuation techniques using the best information\navailable, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and\ndiscounted cash flow projections.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities\nhave fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\n**Inventories**\n\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost o",
    "ed at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing\noverhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net\nrealizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of\ncompletion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and\nthe estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a\nreduction in utility below",
    " our review indicates a\nreduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a\nnew cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation,\nand depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\nestimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated\nuseful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows:\ncomputer software developed or acquired for",
    "llows:\ncomputer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years;\ncomputer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five\nto 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture\nand equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n\n**Leases**\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases\nare included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, other\ncurrent liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidate",
    "and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment,\nother current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease\nterm and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present\nvalue of l",
    " commencement date based on the present\nvalue of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do\nnot provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing\nrate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized\nborrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement\ndate. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments\nmade and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options\nto extend or terminate the lease when it is ",
    "tions\nto extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we\nwill exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are\ngenerally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such\nas vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a\nsingle lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio ap",
    " certain equipment leases, we\napply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating\nlease ROU assets and liabilities.\n\n**Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating\nsegment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis\n(May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its carrying value.\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nOur intangib",
